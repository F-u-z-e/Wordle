It solves wordles for you.
It tells you what to do for the most part.
The word it tells you to guess has a score next to it -- this is just the score given to it by the funny algorithm, so I wouldn't worry about it.
If it gives you a word that wordle doesn't let you guess I can't really help you tbh but it shouldn't happen unless you're using a weird wordle infinite website.

EXTRA COMMANDS:
quit - quits the program
next - moves onto the next wordle puzzle
skip - skips a guess (honestly i only use it to ask it for the best starting word i don't know what else you would do with it)
info - debug thingy that tells you what information it has
pass - lets you give your guess without telling you the best guess
oops - if you put in your guess wrong this undos that
