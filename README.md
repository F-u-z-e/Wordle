It tells you what to do for the most part.

EXTRA COMMANDS:
quit - quits the program
next - moves onto the next wordle puzzle
skip - skips a guess (honestly i only use it to ask it for the best starting word i don't know what else you would do with it)
info - debug thingy that tells you what information it has
pass - lets you give your guess without telling you the best guess
